The Loan dataset is a dataset from Prosper Loans, a San Francisco California based company in the peer-to-peer lending industry. In this projects i will be exploring loan data containing over 113,000 observations and 81 variables, some of the notable information provided for each borrower includes;

`Employment Status` - The employment status of the borrower at the time they posted the listing.

Amongst 76 other variables

## Summary of all findings
Upon conclusion of Part I(exploration) Below is a summary of all the findings:

1. It is no surprise that California the state housing the company boasts the highest number of borrowers from the company.
2. We find that people mostly take loans when festive periods approach towards the end of the year and into the new year, and the top reasons for taking these loans is Debt consolidation and Home improvement.
3. We observe that the Debt to Income Ratio of most of the borrowers is relatively low as also their credit score range is fairly good and manageable.
4. It is also observed that this company mostly gives out long term loans as against medium terms
5. Generally there has been an uptrend in the total number of borrowers over the years from 2005, with the peak in 2013
6. We observed the average earners i.e people who earn between `$25,000- $75,000` make up the largest chunk of borrowers
7. We also found that the higher you earn the more likely it was for one to be a homeowner, starting from those who earn more i.e 100k+ it was discovered that they are two times more likely to be Home owners and the trend generally decreases from there.
8. There is a relationship between Income range and Loan amount as there is a consistent increase in the mean and percentile as income range increases.
9. Lastly we observed Home owners are doing better and fairly so across all Income range in accessing higher loan amounts.
